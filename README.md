Ensure you have Python 3.12 or higher installed. Then, install **pydantic-all-in-one** via pip:

```sh
pip install pydantic-all-in-one
```

Alternatively, install from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/pydantic-all-in-one.git
cd pydantic-all-in-one
poetry install
```

## Getting Started

### Defining Intelligent Models with DSLModel

Leverage **DSLModel** to create dynamic, intelligent models using Jinja2 templates and AI-assisted code generation.

```python
# models.py

from typing import List, Optional
from pydantic import Field
from dslmodel import DSLModel, init_lm

# Initialize language model for AI-assisted generation
init_lm()  # Sets the language model to 'gpt-4o-mini'

class ComplianceRequirement(DSLModel):
    """Represents a compliance requirement under the EU AI Act."""
    requirement_id: str = Field(..., description="Unique identifier for the requirement.")
    description: str = Field(..., description="Description of the compliance requirement.")
    risk_level: str = Field(..., description="Risk level associated with the requirement.")

class AIComponent(DSLModel):
    """Represents an AI component within the system."""
    component_id: str = Field(..., description="Unique identifier for the AI component.")
    functionalities: List[str] = Field(..., description="List of functionalities.")
    compliance_status: str = Field(..., description="Compliance status with the EU AI Act.")
```

Generate models from templates:

```python
# generate_models.py

from models import AIComponent

component_template = """
Component ID: {{ uuid4() }}
Functionalities:
{% for func in functionalities %}
- {{ func }}
{% endfor %}
Compliance Status: Pending
"""

functionalities = ["Data Processing", "Automated Decision Making", "User Interaction"]

# Create an AIComponent instance using the template
ai_component = AIComponent.from_prompt(component_template, functionalities=functionalities)

print(ai_component.json(indent=2))
```

### Implementing Service Colonies for EU AI Act Compliance

Develop a **Service Colony** architecture where autonomous services (inhabitants) collaborate to ensure compliance with the EU AI Act.

```python
# service_colony.py

from dslmodel import FSMMixin, trigger
from enum import Enum, auto
from typing import List

class ComplianceState(Enum):
    INIT = auto()
    ASSESSING = auto()
    COMPLYING = auto()
    MONITORING = auto()

class ComplianceInhabitant(FSMMixin):
    def __init__(self, component: AIComponent):
        super().__init__()
        self.component = component
        self.setup_fsm(state_enum=ComplianceState, initial=ComplianceState.INIT)

    @trigger(source=ComplianceState.INIT, dest=ComplianceState.ASSESSING)
    def assess_risk(self):
        print(f"Assessing risk for {self.component.component_id}")
        # Perform risk assessment...

    @trigger(source=ComplianceState.ASSESSING, dest=ComplianceState.COMPLYING)
    def implement_compliance(self):
        print(f"Implementing compliance measures for {self.component.component_id}")
        # Implement compliance...

    @trigger(source=ComplianceState.COMPLYING, dest=ComplianceState.MONITORING)
    def start_monitoring(self):
        print(f"Starting monitoring for {self.component.component_id}")
        # Start monitoring...

    def forward(self, event: str):
        super().forward(event)
        print(f"Processing event: {event}")
```

Instantiate inhabitants and simulate compliance workflow:

```python
# main.py

from service_colony import ComplianceInhabitant
from models import AIComponent

component = AIComponent(
    component_id="comp-123",
    functionalities=["Automated Decision Making"],
    compliance_status="Pending"
)

inhabitant = ComplianceInhabitant(component)
inhabitant.assess_risk()
inhabitant.implement_compliance()
inhabitant.start_monitoring()
```

### Dynamic Class Generation

Use **DSLClassGenerator** for dynamic class creation based on prompts.

```python
# class_generator.py

from dslmodel.generators.gen_models import DSLClassGenerator
from pathlib import Path

# Generate a new Pydantic model class from a prompt
prompt = """
Create a Pydantic model class named 'RiskAssessment' with fields:
- assessment_id: str
- component_id: str
- risk_level: str
- findings: List[str]
- recommendations: List[str]
"""

generator = DSLClassGenerator(
    model_prompt=prompt,
    file_path=Path('./generated_models.py'),
    append=True
)

generator()
```

Generated class (`generated_models.py`):

```python
from typing import List
from pydantic import BaseModel

class RiskAssessment(BaseModel):
    assessment_id: str
    component_id: str
    risk_level: str
    findings: List[str]
    recommendations: List[str]
```

### Workflow Management and Scheduling

Define and execute complex workflows using **Workflow**, **Job**, and **Action**, and schedule tasks with **aioclock**.

```python
# workflow.py

from dslmodel.workflow import Workflow, Job, Action, Condition, CronSchedule
from aioclock import AioClock, Every

# Define actions
action_assess = Action(
    name="Assess Risk",
    code="inhabitant.assess_risk()"
)

action_implement = Action(
    name="Implement Compliance",
    code="inhabitant.implement_compliance()"
)

action_monitor = Action(
    name="Start Monitoring",
    code="inhabitant.start_monitoring()"
)

# Define job
job = Job(
    name="Compliance Workflow",
    steps=[action_assess, action_implement, action_monitor]
)

# Define workflow
workflow = Workflow(
    name="EU AI Act Compliance Workflow",
    jobs=[job],
    context={"inhabitant": inhabitant}
)

# Schedule workflow execution
clock = AioClock()

@clock.task(trigger=Every(hours=24))
async def scheduled_workflow():
    workflow.execute()
```

### Event-Driven Architecture with FastStream and Redis

Implement an event-driven architecture using **FastStream** and **Redis**.

```python
# event_stream.py

from faststream import FastStream
from faststream.redis import RedisBroker
from models import ComplianceRequirement

broker = RedisBroker("redis://localhost:6379")
app = FastStream(broker)

@app.subscriber("compliance/requirements")
async def handle_requirement(data: ComplianceRequirement):
    print(f"Received compliance requirement: {data.requirement_id}")
    # Process requirement...

@app.publisher("compliance/status")
async def publish_status(status: dict):
    await broker.publish("compliance/status", status)
```

### Graph and Relational Data Management

Manage graph data with **GQLAlchemy** and relational data with **SQLModel**.

```python
# data_management.py

from gqlalchemy import Memgraph, Node
from sqlmodel import SQLModel, Field, create_engine, Session

# Memgraph setup
memgraph = Memgraph()

class ComponentNode(Node):
    component_id: str
    compliance_status: str

# SQLModel setup
class ComplianceRecord(SQLModel, table=True):
    id: int = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)
    component_id: str
    status: str

engine = create_engine("sqlite:///compliance.db")
SQLModel.metadata.create_all(engine)
```

### Data Handling and Vector Management

Use **DataReader** and **DataWriter** for data handling, and **LanceDB** for vector data management.

```python
# data_io.py

from dslmodel import DataReader, DataWriter
from lancedb.pydantic import pydantic_to_schema
from models import ComplianceRequirement

# Reading data
data_reader = DataReader(file_path="data/requirements.csv")
requirements = data_reader.forward()

# Writing data
data_writer = DataWriter(data=requirements, file_path="output/processed_requirements.csv")
data_writer.forward()

# LanceDB schema
requirement_schema = pydantic_to_schema(ComplianceRequirement)
```

### CLI Integration with Typer

Create powerful command-line interfaces using **Typer**.

```python
# cli.py

import typer

app = typer.Typer()

@app.command()
def assess(component_id: str):
    """Assess compliance for a component."""
    # Perform assessment...
    typer.echo(f"Compliance assessment started for {component_id}")

@app.command()
def status(component_id: str):
    """Check compliance status of a component."""
    # Check status...
    typer.echo(f"Compliance status for {component_id}: Compliant")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app()
```
