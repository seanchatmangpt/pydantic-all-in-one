# pydantic-all-in-one

`pydantic-all-in-one` is designed to bring together a set of Python tools centered around Pydantic, simplifying the creation of APIs, handling relational and graph data, and enabling event-driven programming. The project is structured to make data validation seamless and to integrate well with both SQL and graph databases.

## Architecture Overview

This project follows a modular approach:
- **FastAPI** serves as the primary API layer, offering endpoints that interact with other services.
- **GQLAlchemy** facilitates connections to a **Memgraph** database, providing a powerful tool for managing complex relationships and graph data.
- **SQLModel** supports operations with **SQLite**, ensuring a smooth interaction between Python data models and SQL tables.
- **FastStream** manages event streaming, enabling asynchronous communication and processing.
- **Lancedb** is used for storing and retrieving vector data, suitable for AI/ML use cases.
- **aioclock** provides utilities for scheduling tasks that require precise timing.

## Development Guidelines

To contribute:
- Follow PEP8 standards for formatting.
- Use Poetry to manage dependencies and environment configurations.
- Write tests using `pytest` and ensure all tests pass before pushing code.
- Use `poethepoet` for running common tasks like linting and testing.

## Business Context

The primary goal of this project is to streamline the setup and use of Pydantic-related libraries in a Python application. By integrating tools like **FastAPI**, **GQLAlchemy**, and **SQLModel**, it reduces the complexity of working with hybrid data models. The inclusion of event streaming capabilities makes it suitable for applications that require real-time processing.

## Quality Assurance

Testing is managed through `pytest` and `mypy` for type checking, ensuring type safety and robust functionality. Code quality is maintained with pre-commit hooks using `ruff` for linting. Coverage reports are generated with a threshold of 85% to ensure critical paths are well-tested.

## Deployment and Operations

Deployment is managed using **Docker**, ensuring consistent environments from development to production. The **docker-compose.yml** file is used to orchestrate services for easy setup. For larger deployments, **Kubernetes** can be used to manage scaling. Continuous integration and deployment are handled through **GitHub Actions**, ensuring each change is tested and verified before it reaches production.
